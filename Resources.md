This is where I'll be posting my favourite books and other learning materials that greatly helped me in learning certain topics.

### Mathematics
* Imperial College London's [Mathematics for Machine learning specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) teaches newcomers the (higher-level) basics in calculus and linear algebra before showing how these are applied in Neural Networks, K-Means and Principal Component Analysis.

### Reinforcement Learning
* Sutton & Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

* If you prefer video materials: [David Silver's lectures at UCL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) based on the same book

* On coursera: Based on the same book, with coding assignments and quizzes: University of Alberta's [Reinforcement Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)

### Optimisation
* Convex Optimisation: Stephen Boyd's Stanford lectures on [Convex Optimisation I and II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3940DD956CDF0622) based on Vandenberghe and Boyd's [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/). Boyd is a charismatic and funny teacher, who can seamlessly illucidate some of the more dense material of the field while also teaching a thing or two about control theory.
