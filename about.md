I am a PhD candidate at Imperial College London, expected to graduate in 2024.

 Throughout my undergrad experience, also at Imperial with a year abroad at Columbia University, I have had wide exposure to mechanistic modelling of bioprocesses and numerical methods. Before starting my PhD, I had some exposure to bioprocess modelling research experience, but it was my industrial business internships at BASF and ExxonMobil that taught me the importance of digitalisation and especially data-driven techniques in tomorrow's process industries.

Currently, I am a part of [Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.del-rio-chanona)'s [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/optimisation-and-machine-learning-for-process-engineering/about-us/) (OptiML_PSE) group, co-supervised by [Prof. Nilay Shah](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.shah).

## Research interests

In my project *'Data-driven methods for the smart operation of interconnected process systems'*, I plan to investigate the implementation of machine learning and data-driven techniques into the optimisation and control of large-scale, interconnected, multi-agent systems. Expertise in surrogate and derivative-free optimisation will be underlying all specific avenues I will be exploring:

1.  When systems cannot be handled in a centralized manner, either due to their size, physical barriers, data sharing protocols or complexity,  one can address their modelling and optimisation via distributed algorithms. My contributions will focus on new methods for the quick coordination of non-convex subproblems using data-driven optimisation, while respecting privacy and organisational considerations of all involved agents and stakeholders. This includes research into the optimal decomposition of the system into distributed or hierarchical subsystems (community detection).
2. Vertical integration of hierarchical layers of decision-making from operations (control and scheduling) to tactical and strategic decisions (planning and supply chain management) is key for companies to remain competitive in the increasingly stringent economic, safety and environmental requirements of the process industries. Approaching this integration using monolithic or multi-level optimisation frameworks quickly becomes intractable. To this end, I will look at optimal control and feasibility surrogates to improve the computational tractability of these problems.
3. Other areas I will explore later on include leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making under uncertainty, and the use of surrogates in approximate dynamic programming aka Reinforcement Learning.

These methods will be tested on various process-wide control and enterprise-wide supply chain operation case studies within the framework of an industrial collaboration with BASF.
