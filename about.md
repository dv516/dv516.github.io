I am a third-year PhD candidate at Imperial College London, expected to graduate in 2024.
Currently, I am a part of [Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.del-rio-chanona)'s [Optimisation and Machine Learning for Process Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/optimisation-and-machine-learning-for-process-engineering/about-us/) (OptimalPSE) group, co-supervised by [Prof. Nilay Shah](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.shah).

My work is situated at the intersection of optimization and Machine Learning applied to process systems. I am investigating how data-driven techniques can be used to aid in the solution of integrated manufacturing systems and supply chains. By working in close collaboration with industry, I ensure that my case studies are industrially relevant and that my algorithms respect the organizational and business considerations of the process industries.

## Research interests

- Data-driven optimization ; Derivative-free optimization ; Black-box optimization ; CUATRO 

- Data-driven/Derivative-free optimization for coordination or bi-level problems in enterprise-wide optimization

- Optimization with embedded (Machine Learning) surrogates
